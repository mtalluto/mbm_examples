# Examples for "Multifaceted Biodiversity Modelling"

The worked examples here require a companion R package, `mbmtools`, available for installation via R (compilation required):

    devtools::install_github("mtalluto/mbmtools")
    library("mbmtools")

Data are also required; please contact the maintainers of this repo for access.

Most of the hard work is done in python (tested with 2.7; no guarantees on anything working in 3.x). An installation of the [GPy package](https://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/) is required.
